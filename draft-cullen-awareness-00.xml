      <t>
          Awareness is a network ideology and protocol which attempts to generalize and address the difficulties of API continuity, functionality reuse, and service discovery in internet-connected applications. It proposes a novel architecture of information representation and processing between network-connected services, and defines methodology for computational configuration of relationships between operations on data.

        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in

      </t>
      <t>
        At a high level, Awareness represents each available data-processing function available on the network as an independent node with its own set of numerical inputs and outputs. Each node additionally maintains a directory of other nodes whose functionality is accessible. The network's goal is to collaboratively utilize the communication resources and computational ability of other accessible nodes to effectively assemble a processing pathway for the solution of a problem. A node may access the functinoality of other nodes in its directory (e.g. provide it with input and receive its output), ask a node in its directory to search for an optimal assignment of sample data to its inputs in order to produce desired outputs, or request that a node in its directory investigate the functionality of other known nodes in order to assemble a pipeline that meets the requirements of the requestor.
      </t>
      <t>
          This document first outlines the reasoning for suggestion of such an architecture, and then proceeds to specify a protocol for its use.

        <t>
            This section overviews the structures and units of processing used in Awareness, and describes the features of each and their contribution to the entire functionality-distribution network. This section is intended to provide a high-level overview of the system, and does not specify implementation requirements.

        <section anchor="DataRepresentation" title="Data Representation">

                This section describes the units of data storage and manipulation whose use is necessary in other parts of the Awareness system.

            <section anchor="Item" title="Item">
                <t>
                    The concept of Awareness is based on a very simple representation of data where each of the multiple parameters comprising a data point is stored as a floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. A single data point, or item, is an array of one or more of these parameters. A data item's parameters carry meaning by their order, and are implicitly numerically indexed. Data items used for a specific purpose always maintain their parameter content and meaning (the number of parameters nor the parameter order does not change). Data items' parameters have 64-bit (double) precision. Although initially it might seem difficult to encode non-numeric data in such a representation, the practice of exclusively allowing a numerical representation makes data easier to be computationally understood by means of machine learning.

            <section anchor="Set" title="Set">
                <t>
                    It is often necessary to store and manipulate collections of data points, which are known as Sets. A Set provides the structure necessary to encode the input and output of a Function over multiple iterations, and additionally can be used to model a new Function. It consists of two 'streams' of Items - one for input, and one for output. Within one stream, the number of parameters present in each Item contained in the stream must be equal. For example, a Set might have input Items all containing 4 parameters, and output Items all containing 1 parameter. The number of Items contained in all two streams within a Set will be equal.
                </t>
            </section>
            <section anchor="Assembly" title="Assembly">
                <t>
                    An Assembly is used to store data representing a completed pipeline of data processing over the network, which is comprised of uses of the Functions of one or more accessible Endpoints (which refer to other Nodes over the network). It internally specifies the assignments between inputs of each function used and the outputs of the previous one, which are determined optimally for the modeling of a specific Set, by an Algorithm. Thus, each Assembly has a Set for which it is modeled.

            <section anchor="Node" title="Node">
                <t>
                    A Node is a unit of network-connected functionality, which contains variable-length lists of Functions, Endpoints, Algorithms, and Assemblies. It maintains, through its list of Functions, one or more network-accessible operations on data whose implementations are local (e.g. they describe operations which can be carried out without the need for network interaction). Through its list of Endpoints, it maintains knowledge of the other Nodes on the network, which can be asked remotely to provide operations on data through their own local Functions. Its Algorithms each manage a recursive search operation being performed over the Endpoints with which the Node is in contact, and its Assemblies store known pipelines of network-accessible data processing derived from such recursive search operations.
                </t>
            </section>
            <section anchor="Ability" title="Ability">
                <t>
                    A Function is representative of one locally-implemented, but network-accessible operation on data. A Function takes data as input and provides data as output. Each of the two uses of data (input and output) necessary within a Function is manipulated as an Item with a specific number of parameters. Therefore, a given Function has a unchanging input data 'size' (number of Item parameters), and an unchanging output data 'size'. A Function provides the ability for input data to be provided in exchange for output data.

                    An Algorithm provides the recursive search method that is described in more detail in the Processing Analysis section. In summary, it is provided with a Set for which a suitable Assembly must be created (that as closely as possible models the inputs, states, and outputs of the Items of the Set), a recursion limit, and a time limit within which the process must be completed. It enacts a search over the Endpoints accessible from a Node in order to begin, within each, an identical search operation and evaluates the suitability of the results provided (in the form of an Assembly which approximates as closely as possible the input Set) by each.
